# VPhysicsRig

This is a physics rig completely made by **void!** made for fun and for others to use and modify. I coded everything except for half of the grabbing script because xr inputs was set up wrong and i didn’t feel like setting it up so i got chatgpt to support the current state of the xr input system i had.

# Recommended Physics Settings

i recommend using 5000 spring and 150 damper, the settings it comes with. to use your own go to the left and right hand physics and change it to your liking!

# Do Not Sell!

Note : there is no speed cap to how fast you can go and no arm length cap.

Second Note : If there’s any bugs dm me @void1_dev them and i will try and fixing them. also when i post the github link i encourage you to make forks with your own settings!
